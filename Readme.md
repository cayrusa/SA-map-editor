This is the map editor of Shattered Ascension, which can be used [here](https://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/MapEditor/SA-map-editor/).

# Getting startet

If you have Node installed, run 
- `npm install`  
  to install all dependencys
- `npm run build`  
   to generate the `dist` folder that you can deploy to your server
- `npm run buildCode`
   same as `build`, but does not repackage the assets to save time (assumes `build` has already been run once to get the assets)
- `npm run dev`  
  to serve the website on local host.

## Assets
This repository does not contain the image files for the tiles and tokens to
avoid dealing with heavy files. They are available
[here](https://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/MapEditor/assets.zip) (extract the
archive in the *assets* folder). The build script can automate that.
